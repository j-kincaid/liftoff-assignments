### Overview
“An Application for the Charlotte Street Foundation Open Studios Event”

The Charlotte Street Foundation, a Kansas City arts nonprofit, hosts residencies for artists on the sixth floor of the Town Pavilion. Every April, in an Open Studios event, the public is invited for an inside look at the artistic practice of our residents and their creative processes. 

This year, a visual artist named Benjamin Willis will sell grilled cheese sandwiches for $10 in his studio. In order to receive a free sandwich, event attendees must visit the studio of each resident, where they will receive a code to be entered in their mobile device upon touring the studio. Upon registration at the door, visitors will select from tantalizing breads and cheeses (including vegan options). When the passport is complete, it can be redeemed for 100% discount for the price of a sandwich.
